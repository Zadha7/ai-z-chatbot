            <h2>User Responsibility for Content</h2>
            <p>You are solely responsible for all content, files, images, text, and documents you upload, process, or create using Free ITMT Tool. You represent and warrant that:</p>
            <ul>

            <h2>Accuracy and Quality of Results</h2>
            <p>While we strive to provide reliable and high-quality tools, the accuracy and quality of results may vary depending on numerous factors including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Input file quality and format</li>
                <li>Browser compatibility and performance</li>
                <li>Device capabilities and available memory</li>
                <li>User settings and configuration choices</li>
                <li>Complexity of the task being performed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Results should be reviewed and verified before use, especially for critical applications. We make no guarantees about the precision, accuracy, or suitability of tool outputs for any particular purpose.</p>

            <h2>OCR and Text Extraction Accuracy</h2>
            <p>The Image to Text tool uses optical character recognition (OCR) technology that may not achieve 100% accuracy. Factors affecting accuracy include image quality, text clarity, fonts, languages, and formatting. Users should always review and verify extracted text for correctness before relying on it for any purpose.</p>

            <h2>PDF Processing Limitations</h2>
            <p>PDF merging, creation, and conversion tools may not preserve all original document features, including but not limited to: formatting, fonts, embedded media, interactive elements, security settings, metadata, and accessibility features. Processed PDFs should be reviewed to ensure they meet your requirements.</p>

            <h2>Image Processing and Watermarking</h2>
            <p>Image watermarking and processing tools may alter image quality, resolution, or file size. Watermarks may not provide complete protection against unauthorized use or removal by sophisticated users. We recommend using professional copyright protection services for valuable or sensitive images.</p>

            <h3>File Size and Performance Limitations</h3>
            <p>Free ITMT Tool operates within browser memory constraints. Processing very large files or multiple files simultaneously may cause:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Slow performance or processing delays</li>
                <li>Browser unresponsiveness or crashes</li>
                <li>Incomplete or failed operations</li>
                <li>Reduced output quality</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We recommend adhering to suggested file size limits and processing files in smaller batches when necessary.</p>

            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Free ITMT Tool, its operators, affiliates, partners, and service providers shall not be liable for any:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages</li>
                <li>Loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities</li>
                <li>Costs of procurement of substitute services</li>
                <li>Damages arising from errors, interruptions, defects, delays, or failures in service delivery</li>
                <li>Damages resulting from unauthorized access, data breaches, or security incidents</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This limitation applies regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise) and whether we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
